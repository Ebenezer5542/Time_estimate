# Accra Commute Estimator

## Overview
The **Accra Commute Estimator** is a Flask-based web application that predicts the estimated arrival time for commuters in Accra based on:
- Departure time (via a modern time picker)
- Mode of transport
- Home location
- Office location

ðŸ”— **Try it here:** [Live App on Render](https://time-estimate.onrender.com)
The application uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions based on historical commute data.

## Features
- **User-Friendly UI:** Modern Bootstrap interface with a responsive card layout and iconography.
- **Smart Time Input:** JavaScript-powered time picker (Flatpickr) for easy selection.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Get an estimated time of arrival instantly after submitting details.
- **Persistent Form Values:** All inputs remain visible after prediction for easy adjustments.
- **Model Integration:** Uses a pre-trained model to make accurate commute time predictions.
