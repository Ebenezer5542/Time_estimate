# Accra Commute Estimator

## Overview
The **Accra Commute Estimator** is a Streamlit web application that predicts the estimated arrival time for commuters in Accra based on:
- Departure time
- Mode of transport
- Home location
- Office location

The application uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions based on historical commute data.

## Features
- **User Input:** Select your town and enter your departure time.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Get an estimated time of arrival based on your inputs.
- **Data Processing:** Converts user inputs into numerical formats that the model understands.
- **Model Integration:** Uses a pre-trained model to make accurate commute time predictions.

## Installation
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time_estimate.git
cd time_estimate
```
### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
